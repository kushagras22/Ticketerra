### Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env.local` at the project root:

```bash

### Local Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/sonnysangha/ticket-marketplace-saas-nextjs15-convex-clerk-stripe-connect

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Launch development server
npm run dev

# In a second terminal, start Convex backend
npx convex dev
```

Keep the Convex process running so database schemas and functions stay in sync.

### Clerk Configuration

2. Set up sign-in and sign-up providers.
3. Add authorized redirect URLs.
4. Populate environment variables in `.env.local`.

npx convex init
```

4. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` with your deployment URL.
5. Run the development backend:

```bash
npx convex dev
```

### Stripe & Webhook Setup

1. Enable Stripe Connect in your dashboard.
2. Define webhook endpoints for payment and refund events.
3. Install the Stripe CLI:

```bash
# macOS

# Windows (scoop)
scoop install stripe

# Debian/Ubuntu
curl -s https://packages.stripe.dev/api/security/keypair/stripe-cli-gpg/public \
  | gpg --dearmor \

  https://packages.stripe.dev/stripe-cli-debian-local stable main" \
  | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/stripe.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install stripe
```

4. Authenticate the CLI:

```bash

stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
```

6. Copy the webhook secret and update `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env.local`.
7. Ensure your `/api/webhooks/stripe` route correctly handles incoming events.
